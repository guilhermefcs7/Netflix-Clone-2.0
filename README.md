### Project Status

Done  ✅

### How does it work ? 

This project consists nothing more than an evolution of a netflix clone made by me present in this same github. This time I made the decision to build it end-to-end as a full stack project, using Next.js, Typescript and Prisma as the database. I decided to make it even more faithful to the visual and functional identity of the real netflix, having mainly the Bookmarking functions, and watching movies.
